13,When you zoom in it doesnt even look like the LED shape,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 13, 2018","Not what i got as advertised. When you zoom in it doesnt even look like the LED shape, it is blurry and week. Quality wasn't the greatest when i took the flashlight apart.

23,Not worth a 3star review.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 11, 2018",Because they were $4 each that got them one star. Because they worked they got another. Because they did not work properly two stars is all they are worth.
24,I loaded each flashlight with a with an AA 2 ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 11, 2018","I loaded each flashlight with a with an AA 2,800 mAHr rechargeable battery. They are well-constructed and function well. Beam width adjust is smooth and provides a reasonable range of pinpoint and dispersed. The only con is the three-cycle on/off function to move between high-beam, low-beam and flashing. This is the kind of small and cheap flashlight that one would leave in a backpack or car glove box and know that it will function when it's called upon. In this application ensure that you understand the self-discharge rate of the type of batteries employed and change them accordingly. -Cheers"
25,Great range for a small package,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 11, 2018",We were looking for a decent flashlight for outdoor use - primary in the back yard to spot the pets or other critters.  I took a shot at these since they were on sale. They arrived and we kinda laughed thinking they wouldn't do the job.We were wrong.  Our back yard goes back 80 feet or so.  This thing lights it up in spot mode or the more open mode.  It's great.  I'll be picking up a couple more.

27,Sturdy little lights,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 11, 2018","These are sturdy little flashlights that we plan to use in our kayaks in case we need a light.

32,Love the daily dealz.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 10, 2018",I purchased some larger flashlights recently but needed something that was easier to carry daily. I love the size and the build quality. Plus just one AA battery is nice. They are nice and bright and have a cool zoom feature.

34,One Star,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 10, 2018",These are very cheaply made. Once of these broke after 2 uses.
35,Sturdy little lights that work every time as,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 10, 2018",Sturdy little lights that work every time as advertised
36,"Well-made, bright, and good deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 10, 2018","Wow.  Nicely made.  Work very well with Li Ion 14500 batteries as well as with AA alkaline (of course dimmer).  Not hard to get used to the (stupid) inclusion of Strobe Mode.  They automatically cycle from mode to mode each time you turn them off/on with the tail switch.  Hint to make your life easier (such as it is): When (not if) it turns on automatically (every third time) in strobe mode, just gently push down slightly once or twice on the switch to make it cycle between modes to get what you want.  Instead of ""jumping up and down, screaming and shouting"", just think ZEN thoughts (Ooooommmm.  All is beauty) and gently depress the switch.And think of the amazingness of this: A bright (and cheap and well-made) LED flashlight that operates on one lousy battery at 1 1/2 volts (yes, even cheap light ""heavy duty"" non-alkalines) or an NiMH rechargeable at 1.35 volts and yet is still not destroyed by 3.7 volt Li Ion's.  Would I be as enthusiastic if I'd not got them on sale at 6.99?  Well, maybe a little less because the competition in quantity goes for about $3 to $4 per, and if I buy 5 or 6, I'd be giving away a few to friends and that would be even more fun.One little nit-picky thing: the ""Two Fluorescent Rings Which Shine in the Dark Night"" (not fluorescent but phosphorescent) the ""rings"" seem to be just those (cheap) little silicone rubber bands sold in handi-craft stores that are woven together (mainly by younger people, it seems) to make rings and bracelets.  Yeah, some of those are sold as glow-in-the-dark.  My point is that after a few minutes in the dark, I've seen matches brighter than these -yeah UNLIT matches!One more thing - if you use 14500 Li Ion batteries: EBL 14500 Li-ion Rechargeable Batteries 3.7V 800mAh for LED Flashlight Torch, 8 Packs most of these are what is called ""unprotected"".  In this case, it means if their voltage goes down in the flashlight, they are probably going to be damaged and may never again be able to be charged to full capacity - or at all.  So this is my suggestion: if the ""bulb"" starts dimming or shuts off by itself: immediately open the flashlight and take out the battery.  That way the flashlight cannot draw down its voltage any more.  Since there's no circuit to protect your battery, you have to do it.  This should help you protect your investment and continue to give you the nice bright light these batteries give with these flashlights."

55,Compact and useful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 9, 2018","These are compact size flashlights, fit in palm.  3 light levels with click of button at the end of flash light. It is good for daily use to keep in the pocket for emergencies or just for walking the dog at night. Recommended"
56,Very small which was awesome and it was doing what I bought it for ...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 9, 2018",Very small which was awesome and it was doing what I bought it for until the light stopped turning on. Flashlights seem to have a mind of there own. These would work good for around the house and emergency use but not for any type of work/long periods of off and on usage.
57,Arrived very quickly and seem to be a good product. I admit they were smaller than I ...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 9, 2018","Arrived very quickly and seem to be a good product.

Using 2 in motorhome for camping and 2 for home.  Tried one out at it has a very bright light for its size.  Am going to love carrying a smaller, lighter flashlight around.  Has a clip to hang on belt or purse.  Thanks for a great product."
60,Poor quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 9, 2018",The button doesn't seem to have an actuation point so you seem to have to press rather firmly to change light settings but some times it actuates with little pressure. Edges on the frame feel uncomfortable.
61,Comes in handy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 9, 2018",These flashlights are small but very powerful! I love them and are easy to have anywhere. I recommend this product.
62,"Obnoxious strobe/flashing mode you can't avoid, but decent flashlight.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 8, 2018","FYI, to get it to switch modes, you turn it of then on again and it switches.  It goes from (1) bright --> (2) Dimmer --> (3) Flashing.The flashing is obnoxious.  I wish I could get rid of that.  I see no need for that in my life or 99% of anyone who buys this thing.  It just threatens you with a seizure as you try to quickly switch it off and on to a different mode.But the light is fairly bright.  No big complaints with how it works when it's just on and working."
63,A Golden Pair of Mini Flashlights - YOU HAVE TO CHECK THESE OUT!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 8, 2018","I absolutely LOVE these mini flashlights. They illuminate so much more than one might expect from a device this size and fit cozily in your pocket, in a desk organizer, etc. You never know when you're going to need to light up under your bed, behind a large appliance or the sidewalk out to your garbage cans early in the morning. The monetary trade off is ridiculous with regards to what you get for your hard earned cash. They rest comfortably in the palm of your hand with intuitive motions to light up. Only thing I can't for the life of me figure out is why there's a strobe setting,  but that's just me maybe needing a clue as to a real world application. That said, I am in no way affiliated with this company nor do I foresee any financial compensation for a glowing review. I would have been stoked receiving just one of these flashlights but getting two? i say see for yourself, you won't be disappointed!!"
64,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 8, 2018","Excellent led , portable"
65,Smaller than they look,4.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 8, 2018","They are quite bright and seem to be solidly constructed, but the picture made them seem a bit larger than they really are. They can only hold one AA battery, so if you're expecting the larger kind with the caddy that holds three AAA batteries, you will be a bit disappointed. That said, even as small as they are, the price is very good."
66,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 8, 2018",When I click the button it shines brightly
67,One Star,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 8, 2018",i have to buy batteries  china junk

71,Multi purpose in a compact format,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 7, 2018","Got these two flashlights on sale and well worth the price. Like the small compact size with a lot of light emanating from the bulbs. Great feature of bright, less bright, and a flasher. One is next to the bed, the other in the car for those emergencies. Also, like the ability to focus the beam when necessary. This is the kind of thing that you don't need until you get it. Highly recommend."
72,But I hated the fact that I had to cyclce through the ...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 7, 2018",Decent enough light. But I hated the fact that I had to cyclce through the modes every time i turned it on.
73,Cute and bright flashlight,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 6, 2018","It’s tiny cute flashlight.  As of luminous flux , this little flashlight generates amazing light intensity that can be light up a spot 50 yards, even 100 yards away. There are two light modes, the continuous one and the twinkling one."
74,Better than I was expecting for the price and super ...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 6, 2018",Better than I was expecting for the price and super bright for how tiny they are. If you put a good AA battery in them you will be stoked. I like that the light can focus in on small spaces. Good for exploring tight spaces. I would imagine they would be good in the mechanic industry. I mostly bought them for walking at night so people dont run me over. And for going into tunnels and sewage drains to look for clowns and stuff.
75,under closet repair and kids love it for haunted house,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 6, 2018","This is one of the must haves for each and every family. We used it for night time outdoor exploration, under closet repair and kids love it for haunted house."

79,One of mine had a bad switch.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 5, 2018","They aren't bad lights, Really bright, lightly depress the switch and release to change the operating mode, I Just happened to get one with a bad switch, It pops loudly, occasionally doesn't work or won't turn off. The other flashlight is fine. Oh, the fluorescent lines? Those are silicone/rubber bands that glow in the dark."
80,Total waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 5, 2018",Can’t even get a battery in it. And it’s not bright at all once I finally got the top open. It just kept spinning and spinning. Now I can’t get the batteries out
81,Waste of my money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 5, 2018","1 of the 2 flashlights work. but not as advertised.  Did not find the ""nonreturnable"" part until after receiving the items.  Rechecked the original page for the order and nowhere does it say ""nonreturnable"".  Waste of my money!"

87,Hit and Miss,3.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 4, 2018","Of the two, one worked perfectly, the other would only switch on in dim mode, and needed to be switched to bright mode. They are build solidly and the working one does a good job. Amazon customer service is perfect as always and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. I would try them again,  my guess is I just got a bad one."

91,0/2 working flashlights.  complete garbage.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 4, 2018","So the one I could open to put a battery works ok, but the other one doesn't unscrew so its useless.  Not a great deal.update (5 minutes later) After taking the battery out and trying to reassemble the one that worked, the housing which holds the lens over the LED came off, so 100% garbage.  stay away."

94,NOT 300 LUMENS,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 3, 2018",Overall it is well built for the price however the max output is probably not even 150 lumens. To call this 300 lumens is such false advertisement. It is bright enough to do the job and AA batteries are easy to find and they are cheap enough to loose or keep around.

The only downside is I hate the strobe light because it hurts my eyes and you have to see the strobe in order to turn the flashlight off. The other downside is the flashlight has a lot of blue."

I'm using it with the regular standard batteries just to try them out.  But I'll be buying the high mah batteries.  The higher mah rechargeable  batteries are bit bigger then standard ones.  But no worries these little flashlights have space in them for that bit of over size battery.  And once you turn it on all you have to do is just press it slightly to get your 3 modes. every slight press is different mode."

133,I'm happy (even surprised) with these,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 7, 2018","I don't have a lot of experience with LED flashlights (other than tiny cheapo ones with no replaceable or rechargeable battery), but these seem well worth it.I think i got them at one of Amazon's ""lightning"" specials, so only compared that price, which makes them cheaper than a pair would be of what i thought was an equivalent i picked up at Ace hardware. These are sturdy, seem surprisingly solid & well-made for today's typical plastic crap most everything i order ends up, & are both far brighter than the one about the same size that i got at Ace & are adjustable in focus & have a convenient clip. It's also nice to have 2 intensities & a strobe function. Only disadvantage i can think of is that they're noticeably heavier than the Ace one, so backpackers might want to look for something lighter.BTW, while there may be an advantage to multiple batteries (the Ace requires 3 AAA's!), i like that these require only 1 AA each.So, while i haven't given them a work-out, so far i'm very pleased with these, & surprised at how solid & well-made they seem to be."

Highly recommended for sportsman and women of all activities, kids and folks in general looking for a small, bright, portable flashlight."
148,"Miniature in size & price, but big on light output!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"on February 10, 2018","Given my many prior, poor experiences with several of the low-price/knockoff CREE type LED, zoomable style flashlights I've bought of this design, these lights are a surprisingly good purchase.  I've left off 1 of the 5 stars for 2 main reasons detailed in PRO's/CON's list below:CONS:1- Without (very) fresh batteries, the luminosity quoted in the product description isn't consistently provided by these lights- except on full, fresh batteries, the light is much dimmer than it can be when the light has fully powered batteries in it, so you'll end up going through batteries faster than normal (thankfully, the ""Amazon Basics"" AA batteries are very good quality & are very cheap compared to name-brands, so this is a solveable issue, just wasteful, seeing as you end up tossing batteries which still hold some charge- I've ended up using the 1/2 dead flashlight batteries in my cable box remotes in an effort not to waste them).2- Like many of the economical flashlights being sold of this design type, sometimes the power-button press to cycle between modes happens without your input, turning on the strobe setting or the lower light output setting without my intending to do so by pressing the power button.PROS:1- These lights are very compact, yet with fully charged batteries, they have a high light output for their size. Given the amount of light they provide when fully powered, they do a good job to the point that my wife always keeps one in her purse & her car for being about at night &/or walking our dog after dark.2- Unlike many of the other flashlights I've bought of this design/type, these lights have held up quality-wise over a decent amount of use- working just as they well as they did when they'd 1st arrived.3- The price asked would be inexpensive for 1 CREE-type LED light of this design & high quality, so very good value for a 2 pack!Overall I certainly recommend them if you're looking for a good, low-cost & compact CREE-type LED, zoomable flashlight which works well & is of good quality.."

153,"Great for the price, but not for your “main” light",4.0 out of 5 stars,"on February 6, 2018","Considering how little it costs for two of them, they are well built and very bright.  The issue is with the switch logic.  There is a single switch that turns it on/off (hard press) and changes the mode (half press).  The problem is that each time you turn it on, it switches to the next mode.  So if you are using it in “high” and turn it off, you will get “strobe” next time.  Not a deal breaker, but annoying.Again, great buy to throw in a drawer, but look elsewhere for something to carry every day."

168,... a long time of carrying these disappointments I am glad to say I can buy a new flash light,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on January 18, 2018",After a long time of carrying these disappointments I am glad to say I can buy a new flash light. They are okay for throw away flash lights but they are very undependable and aren't really worth keeping for more than a week. I run a small business that requires me to constantly use a flash light and I bought these as a test run. After about a week they started going in and out. I replaced the batteries and still it only worked about 45% of the time. I'm not a picky person but these had a pretty bad short in their switch so I just kept them in a drawer and used them intermittently. Glad to say though they are finally dead as a door nail and I can replace them with something a lot better.

204,NOT SUITABLE AS BIKE LIGHT!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on January 3, 2018","I bought these to use as a bike headlight. My commute to work is about 20min., which I do by bike after dark 3-4x/wk. I always used the strobe because it is more conspicuous and drains the battery less than a steady beam, and is legal for a bike headlight in Florida. At first I was very happy with the brightness, but after 2-3wks. the light would require many clicks of the switch to turn on. Then it would go dark during my trip, and afterwards it wouldn't come on at all. This started after a total use of less than 3hrs. in strobe function, and the battery still had plenty of charge. I tried the 2nd light, and had a similar experience. Not wanting to continue risking my life, I tried to return the item, but it was not eligable. I am very dis-satisfied."

228,They aren’t super high quality,3.0 out of 5 stars,"on December 19, 2017","These are decent lights to keep around the house or in the car. They aren’t super high quality, one of mine the rubber cover over the on/off switch was installed wrong and it makes it hard to operate the light. I don’t think they are really 300 lumens either. I have a 300 lumen light that I compared it to and these are a lot dimmer. Good cheap flashlight."

230,Complete Junk! Do not buy!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on December 19, 2017","These are complete junk. Worst flashlights I've ever owned. Received as a gift. If I had a way to return, I would.- Very difficult to screw on battery cap on bottom (both).- Switch works intermittently (one).- Treads failed, so switch end keeps popping off (one). May try red thread locker to fix.- Battery gasket ring broke (one) - mostly likely from struggling w/ bottom battery cap (one).If you end up w/ these, change the batteries from the top, rather than the bottom. Never remove bottom battery cap."

242,"one worked, one didnt",3.0 out of 5 stars,"on December 11, 2017","i gave it 3 stars because only one of the flash lights worked.  it didnt seem worth it to send them back since i really only needed one for a Christmas gift, just seemed easier and cheaper to get the two pack.  I put the batteries in and one worked right away while the other only pretends to work if the spring touches the side wall while the battery is in it and that's impossible to use since you have to close the cap to keep the battery inside.  The one that works however is awesome and more than what i expected it to be, flashes, zooms and expands and is very bright for its small size. just wish the other one worked. overall happy with the one that works but disappointed only one worked"
243,Not happy with modes!!!!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on December 10, 2017",I ordered similar lights to this in the past... LOVED THEM!  These however constantly cycle the features each time you turn the light on.For example:First time you turn it on... Super bright.Next time... Dim mode.Next time... Flashing pattern.NORMALLY... These types of flashlights should function:Momentary press button = Changes mode.Turn unit off = Remembers where it was.

246,"Great light, rechargeable battery friendly",5.0 out of 5 stars,"on December 6, 2017","These are very lightweight and last forever on a single AA battery.I use them for evening strolls around (an increasingly dark as winter is upon us) set of streets and the flash mode make me very obvious to oncoming cars.Super lightweight, and built to last. I have been using them for months without an issue. They even work well with rechargeable batteries.One caution: Rechargeable batteries + LED's mean that when the power drops below the minimum the LEDs need, you will find that the light just stops working, unlike a bulb which dies slowly, this can cut off entirely. But keep a good charge and you won't be disappointed."

It's bright for its size-and this goes to the one thing I disliked: one photo shows this lite brightly illuminating both sides of a sidewalk. This doesn't quite do that. That overstatement is what gets this 4 stars instead of 5 from me. I got over that quickly. Ounce for ounce, this unit pulls its weight."

I kept one in my backpack for any emergency that might arise while hiking.  And the other in the car to use at my campsites.  I used the campsite flashlight EVERY night - it's small enough to comfortable fit in your pocket and bright enough to walk the dog and/or walk to the bathroom in near complete darkness and only had to replace the battery once.  The only complaint I have is that it seems to always rotate into strobe mode when I would turn it on - a little irritating, but not a deal breaker."

Id say theyre more around 90-110lumens. 3/4 have scratched lenses which isnt too much of an issue but considering theyre scratched on the inside, it could come as a concern to others."

291,Great for the kids while Camping,3.0 out of 5 stars,"on November 7, 2017","Even though, the wide angle gives a decent spray of light. With a fresh battery, these lights struggled to light the bushes from 50 yards away. That does not mean if you want to use these babies in the attic, while checking the rat traps, you wont have great light, but when you zoom the lens for a tighter Beam... you'll find a ""square"" which is emitted by the LED module/crystal. Which is okay, (for kids) but not great if you need to really see that ""thing"" that is right there... LOOKIN BACK AT YOU ......  All in all, this is great deal for a four pack of flashlights that you can give to the kids for a camping trip, to keep them all on the same wave, but if you're looking for something else to keep you out of the dark, and give yourself a chance to stay ahead of the critters... try something else."

329,Not rugged. Not even a little...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on October 24, 2017","I got this in June of this year.  After less than four months, it's broken.  Something is rattling around inside, it won't zoom in all the way any more, and there are two rubber band like things that (I'm guessing) used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn't working any more.  My work backpack has a pocket on the shoulder strap. It had been in that pocket for maybe a month before I discovered it had broken.This flashlight is not rugged. Not even a little.  If clipping it on an office worker's backpack for a month breaks something... Well let's just say I'm glad I didn't get into a situation where I was relying on this light. Very glad.Oh, and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty, how to return it, etc.  Honestly, I wouldn't accept a replacement. Only a refund.One other and less important gripe: The pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything.  That's why I put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap. I couldn't even get the clip over the edge of my jeans pocket without using a tool to pry it open.Move on...get something else. Anything.  A glow stick would be better and last longer."

These flashlights do have glow in the dark rings that the competitors don't come with. Useful in emergency situations and will glow only if exposed to light beforehand. My main gripe is that the flashlights do not use the same mode again when you turn them on next time. It will choose the next mode. I like to use the high mode, but the next time I turn it on it will switch to low mode. If I leave it on low mode, it'll switch to strobe the next time I turn it on. Very frustrating having to cycle the modes each time."

I haven't used one long enough to expend the single AA cell but the amount of light they put out from 1.5 volts defies belief.

352,Awesome and bright flashlight,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on October 17, 2017","These flashlights are great!  They work off of a standard AA battery which are cheap and easy to get.  Nice looking and great build.  High beam, low beam, and flashing.  The size of the beam is adjustable by sliding the lens in/out and once the flashlight is on you can change modes by lightly tapping the orange button.  I did get these flashlights at a highly discounted price but they are definitely worth the full price of $5 each!"

The other still works great. Like all the other flashlights that look exactly like this it's a cheap copy of some high end design so quality control is not great."

Easy to carry in a purse, pack, coat pocket, or car.  I use these with the mini butterball 14500 batteries.  The total cost for the flashlights, batteries, and charger is about $20 for two.  I like the strobe mode for use as an emergency signal.  My only ""beef"" with the flashlight industry in general is the black color.  Seriously?  The point of a flashlight is to improve visibility in the darkness.  Try finding a jet black flashlight during a power outage!  Flashlights should be neon yellow or orange.  I don't care what they look like.  I want something I can easily find and use.  Please stop making black colored flashlights or provide options."

What I got was essentially a $3 flashlight with a metal casing.First impressions were it was alittle lighter than I imagined.The light was not even that bright. I dug out a $1.99 Harbor Freight LED flashlight and compared the 2 on my basement wall. The H Freight one out shined the Rockbird one easily.

Runs on one AA battery which is easy to change. The LED is easily changed as well if needed. There were two in the package. The main problem is that there are three modes: bright, dim and bright strobe and you need to cycle thru all of them to get to the one you want. Every time you turn it on. It does not stay on the last mode used."

414,Delighted with this 6-pack of small,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 26, 2017","Delighted with this 6-pack of small, VERY bright flashlights.Only minor quibble is that it's unclear when pressing the ""On"" button will turn on a solid light, versus turning on a rapidly-flashing light.(Apparently the flashing light - which may or may not come on - is to confuse all those terrible criminals that are trying to attack you ... 'cause, you know, you're so likely to face that ""tactical"" situation.)Other quibblette is that it'd be nice to be able to remove the pocket-clip (but it's attached with 2 unusual screws). On the other hand, if it was removed, then the flashlight would roll freely on any surface on which one might lay it - which would NOT be ""desirable"".  So, at least the pocket-clip keeps the otherwise completely round flashlight from rolling when layed-down.All in all, I LIKE 'em - a LOT!  :-)"

Battery is not included though."

I keep one in the kitchen (for finding equipment in all the dark corners of cabinets) and one next to the attic door (I'm afraid I use the attic as kind of an extended storage closet).  They're very bright and I particularly like the ability to broaden or narrow the beam.  They're generally all-around handy for those of us with poor vision who need an extra boost of light at times.  They're also great for finding a pet that's hiding from you because it doesn't want it's medicine.

However after using for one camping trip (right out of the box) the power button/mode selector on the flashlight has developed a short. It is indecisive on whether or not it will turn on at all when clicked, and the half click to change modes guarantees it shuts off and you're hard pressed to get it to turn back on again. I should have been thorough about putting these through the paces during the return window before trying to rely on them."

469,Very efficient and versatile little flashlights.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 13, 2017",Great little flashlights with good power and variable light beam to fit different situations. They were very useful and efficient in a power outage during a hurricane. I ordered two more.
470,Great Flashlight!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 13, 2017","My wife purchased these under her Amazon account in preparation for a coming hurricane, as backups to our main flashlight. I was very pleasantly surprised by the brightness and quality of the flashlights. They have three modes, dim, strobe, and bright, and I liked them so much that they were used as our primary lights when we lost power. We stood them on end to light an entire room as well as to move about the house from room to room. They were great for checking for damage in the dark once the hurricane had passed. They use only one AA battery each (not included) and they hold a charge for quite a while. We were without power for 27 hours with storm shutters on the house, so it was dark even during the day, and the flashlight that we used to light the main room only needed it's battery changed once."
471,Bought before hurricane Irma. Wanted led flashlights. Small ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 13, 2017","Bought before hurricane Irma. Wanted led flashlights.  Small enough to fit in pocket.  They were exactly what we needed , as our power was off several days.Don't overlook this pair of mini flashlights. They do the job."
472,"Small, but mighty",4.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 13, 2017","These ended up being very handy, but I didn't realize how small they would be. To be fair to the manufacturer I probably didn't grasp what the dimensions they posted really meant so it's in. I way their fault. For those of you who are not as found of math or lack basic sense of  spatial awareness (like me), these little guys are about palm size. Maybe a little smaller or bigger depending on your body proportions, but that's my best comparison out the gate.All that being said these are some nifty flashlights. They have a bright, medium, and strobe setting which you change by halfway pressing the power button. I found that out a bit of a startling way, but was none the less impressed. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase."

One very irritating feature is that pressing the ON button cycles through the flashlight's modes. So, whenever you turn it on, it turns on in low light, strobe, or high (in that order)."

Loving the bright and dim modes but kind of hating the strobe. I guess if you have a BYO strobe party it's cool or you have to defend yourself against a racoon, but otherwise it's another button you have to push to get to bright mode again"

492,"Decent flashlight, but mediocre design regarding the battery",3.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 7, 2017","Bought these to put in my hurricane preparedness kit. They are ok. They feel solid, and the brightness is fine. However, when I put in the battery and tightened the cap the light came on and stayed on despite depressing the button. I loosened the cap a bit and it worked properly, but it seems like a design flaw. Not the best flashlight I've purchased, but I got two for $9.00, so for the price they are ok."

499,Do not buy!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 5, 2017",Horrible lights!! The lights change modes with any bump of the flashlight. I cannot keep them on one mode without them changing modes from power saving to flashing to high beam. Every single bump or vibration will change modes and cause the lid to come off and the battery pop off! Cheap and not worth the money!

513,BE AWARE--NO RETURN,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 2, 2017","I ordered these last week and after putting a battery in the first one thought it seemed like a good product, especially liking the small size.  I tried putting a battery in the second one and it will not close.  Apparently the grooves are stripped so it will not hold the end which secures the battery.  I tried to return and today discovered they are NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN so I have one flashlight instead of two.  I am wondering how long this one will last."
514,Solid feel.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 2, 2017","These lights have a nice, solid feel to them.  I like'em. I have not used them much so I can't comment on the operational quality.  All too often, cheap flashlights tend to start having problems with the on/off buttons or you have to smack them to get the light to turn on.  We'll see how these hold up."
515,Worth it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 1, 2017",Nice little flashlight. A lot of light for something this size. Definitely worth the price.
516,Initial Quality Issues,4.0 out of 5 stars,"on September 1, 2017","One of the flashlights worked great right out of the box. The second light had an issue with the focusing collar. Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried  pushing the button one last time. It worked again! Probably some debris inside the switch worked free. I was going to ask the seller for a new switch as the problem could occur again at some inconvenient future time."

531,Fairly Good Lights for the money!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"on August 30, 2017","Good lights, overall. I do have a couple complaints. But, nothing serious. 1)You can't turn off the 'emergency flashing light' function. Every other time you turn it on, it's on strobe. You have to turn it off and back on to get back to the regular light. There's no switch to shut that part off. 2)The barrel gets really hot after 4-5 minutes. Not burning your hand hot. But, it's not really comfortable after holding it 15-20 minutes. Other than those things, they're great lights. Even with my complaints, I use them almost daily. And, I would recommend them. They're cheap and affordable lights. And, you don't get everything you want on the cheaper economy priced stuff."

533,"Not great, but worth the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"on August 29, 2017","These flashlights aren't as bright as I expected, but they work. I don't really like how each press of the power button cycles through the three settings (bright, dim, flashing). When I press the power, I expect it to always start on the bright setting, but it doesn't. It goes to whatever setting was next in the rotation. It's not a big deal, but it's a little annoying.I would give these 3 stars, but the good price point bumps it up to 4. I didn't pay much for these, so they're mostly worth the price. I have another small flashlight I much prefer, but it was also a lot more expensive."
534,One for the price of two,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on August 29, 2017","Opened the box, grabbed one of the flashlights, twisted the top off, placed the battery.  Seemed to work pretty good.  Then, I grabbed the other flashlight, twisted the... twisted the stuck top, pull the top, WD40 the top, twist the top while holding the body with pliers, threw in trash.  The top was welded on and stripped so badly there was nothing I could do to open it and place the battery.  If you're going to seal it shut, at least provide the battery.  Ridiculous."

The cheap 9 LED flashlights just didn't cut it and it was a lot of trouble having to insert three batteries into the flashlight cartridge. I have only tried out one Rockbird but the results were good. It isn't the most powerful flashlight around but it does the job. It puts out plenty of light and inserting one AA battery is very easy. For general use, it is a very good flashlight. My only con is that it is black and hard to find in the dark and in dark drawers. Wish I was able to get them in silver."

So far I found that the metal bar is so tight that I can't it to clip on any clothing and I am afraid to pry it open too far in case it snaps off.I also received one that was great and one that was significantly dimmer.  Can't blame the batteries as I switched them out with the same results.If they were both the same intensity I would rate them 5 stars.

It has 3 different light modes. The first is a broad normal shine, the second is a more concentrated light such as a spotlight, the third is a blinking emergency type light. It also has a convenient clip located on the side for carting on your bag or clothes. I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. I am glad I ordered the two pack because my husband has already taken one. It is a great gift for men and women. It is great for the hunter or fisherman in your life because of the long range it shines. You will not be disappointed."

Use it when we walk the dogs at night and have them in each of our cars. The way this is constructed, even if you drop it, there’s no way to damage the glass. All you’d get is some dings and scratches on the body. The clip on the body is a nice touch. Plus you get the added benefit of getting 2."

It feels solid in your hand, but is not bulky when on your belt. It is very bright and has a long range. The ability to focus the beam is a very nice feature. The tactical teeth on both sides are not that sharp upon first look, but if used correctly would definitely hurt, especially if twisted upon contact. I have not tested the battery life or water resistance. In conclusion, I would agree that this is the best value all purpose flashlight."

666,Great lights for a great price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on July 11, 2017","These mini LED flashlights are perfect for my little ones to use while we are out camping. They are heavy duty yet light and water resistant so they can withstand the rain (it always rains while camping). With these you have the ability to focus and adjust the intensity of light. There are 3 different modes: high beam, low beam and flashing and it only takes one AA battery. My son loves the handy built-in clip; he can clip the flashlight to his pant pocket, on his shirt or where ever it fancies him. Only flaw to me is that the clip is quite stiff so it can be difficult trying to clip it on but it definitely stays in place. Overall, these are great, sturdy little lights for the money. You get alot of light from such a small flashlight."

Good light overall not great. Disappointed to find out one flashlight doesn't work out of the box brand new. Would've given five stars based on the value. Not an extremely bright light but better than average considering price. They also burn through AAA batteries quickly. Can't get past only getting half of what I paid for...that kills the value part that compensated for the average brightness.

When compared to other 300 lumen and a 200 lumen flashlight I found that with new batteries at its highest setting folly zoomed in, was still visibly dimmer than the 200 lumen flashlight. I bought the two pack, and compared both to each other with both new alkaline and fully charged nickle-cadmium rechargeable batteries and found that they do not even match each other in brightness. They're inexpensive, and were the compact size I was looking for, but it seems you get what you pay for, and in this case you pay for under 200 lumens."

They feel a little ""flimsy"" so not sure how long they will hold up. About what you'd expect for $9, definitely wouldn't spend more than that."
714,Great buy at a great price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on June 27, 2017",I purchased the 2 pack. They arrived quickly. Only take 1 AA battery and it was easy to install. I bought them so I could keep one in my cars glovebox and one either on me or in my apt. For the price they are perfect. Heavy duty housing that doesn't feel cheap. Also has strobe function.

716,It's Okay for the Price,3.0 out of 5 stars,"on June 27, 2017","These are not bad for the price, but you get what you pay for.  Few things to point out: 1. It uses a single AA battery and it is NOT included. 2. It has 3 light modes, bright, flashing-off-and-on quickly, and not-as-bright light modes.  I found this to be bit annoying, when I turn my flashlight on, I just want a bright light but with these, you have cycle through the other modes before you get to the simple ""stay on"" bright light mode.  I guess my fault for not reading the product description bit more carefully."

720,Very Dim and Disappointing.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on June 26, 2017","Incredibly dim. The rubber on the button is warped and bubbled. I found metal shavings in the threading of the battery chamber. Did I mention that it is so dim it's pathetic? I was going to give this as a gift but after trying it out I would be so ashamed if I had given it. Other than the metal shavings, warped rubber button and a pretty poor battery fit it does feel like it does feel like it is a well built flashlight, too bad that its so weak at actually producing light."

723,Not all that good.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on June 25, 2017","To be honest, I'm not impressed. I'm comparing these to my Streamlight Protac, which is also 300 lumens.Firstly, at first glance the construction seems fine. Quality of materials is ok.Secondly, there is no way in Hell that these flashlights are 300 lumens. I'd wager that they aren't even 100 lumens. Not bright at all."

More is better so I can keep one in my truck and keep the second one for other uses. They fit just about anywhere and come with a clip. Secondly, for being a mini flashlight, it puts out a very bright light. And it is adjustable – wide to narrow focus. Plus, they come with 3 modes – bright, dimmer, and flashing. The feel of the flashlight is that of a good quality make – sturdy, easy to grip, and small enough to carry anywhere. Definitely a good buy."

I'm using it with a 2000 mAh NiMH AA battery. It seems to be made of pretty resilient materials. The strobe mode was an added plus not mentioned in the specs. I plan to use the light as a backup signal device for night walk. I was so impressed, I just ordered 2 more for my family. Highly recommends!!!!"

That's only 1.5v. their rather small size is appealing for storage in an automobile or a purse, i suppose. those were the purchase designs here, anyway or it's highly unlikely would have gone this route.contacted the company twice, indicating one worked/one didn't. IDK yet if they've responded; I don't manage this account. my wife's account and I'm the occasional buyer. that said, looking at the order history, there's no clear Amazon indication that any adjustments have been made.lastly, seems one can reasonably expect a hit & miss scenario with these -- notice the irregular pricing, strongly nudging a buyer toward a larger collection. to whit -- we bought a 2-pack for $9.99; now i see both that same 2-pack but also a 4-pack for $12.99.caveat emptor"
809,Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on May 20, 2017","Delivery and packaging was great but the item is poor quality, cheap feeling although it has a metal body.  When screwing on the cap to battery compartment the metal sheered on the threads.  I do not imagine it will be very long lasting.  The light is good, though the pinpoint beam, I expected, would be more spot focused, it is still a fairly wide beam"

We're not talking about a zillion lumens, by any stretch.  But, click the button, the light goes on.  Simple three mode mechanism.  Adjustable bezel, push/pull, to adjust beam size.  Flood setting looks best, but not the brighest.  Worth the buy, in case of an emergency. Besides, AA batteries are cheaper than dirt, and so easy to find."

833,Small but powerful flashlight.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on May 12, 2017",I bought these for my son and his friend to take camping on a school trip. They came in really handy because they got caught in the rain while hiking at night and these worked the entire time (almost one hour) until they got back to their campsite. They are small enough to fit in his jacket pocket so he was the only one to have one with him beside the counselor. We have them in a drawer in our kitchen in case the building loses power and it does all summer so they will come in handy. They are very bright and I would not expect that from such a small flashlight.
834,Piece of Crap - Don't Buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"on May 12, 2017","I wasn't able to open one of them to insert a battery.  Very poor design with the battery portal being combined with a light adjustment feature at the top.  It just turns and turns as though the battery portal is stripped. What a piece a crap!! It was a waste of time trying to open it and an even bigger waste of money!! In addition, the strobe function should work off an exterior switch that can be activated when the light is on. Not when you turn it off and then turn it back on only to have a useless strobe function activated.  That requires you to turn off the light again and turn it back on just to activate its normal function.  One agitated customer!"
835,Very poor light for a flash light,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on May 10, 2017",Don't let the edgy design fool you. Very poor light for a flash light.  Gives off as much as much light as a 3 dollar harbor freight 2 pack.

The loading of the battery is not really complicated, once I read the questions section above the reviews section. Does not come with any description but once you've figured how to load the battery and clicked on the switch you should be good to go."
839,poor buy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on May 7, 2017",One worked. The second one I could not get it open to put the battery in so do not know if it works or not. one good one bad
840,These work wonderfully well!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on May 7, 2017","We often need to head outdoors with no prior warning to deal with issues with the farm animals.  A bright, reliable flashlight that can slip into a pocket is a must for us.Shipping was fast with Amazon Prime and the packaging was excellent.  These flashlights did not come with batteries, but I had some on hand for the flashlights we already own.These flashlights are lightweight and very, very bright.  The adjustable beam allows us to search the woods quickly and then to pinpoint what we're searching for.  Most recently that was a wild raccoon who was tipping our waste cans and stealing food from the barn cats.The clips are strong, enabling us to ensure that the flashlights won't fall out of our pockets while we're working.I have absolutely no complaints and intend to buy these again!"
841,Small but very handy ;),5.0 out of 5 stars,"on May 7, 2017",Great light use it for work.

No batteries included, but it's a single AAA, and puts out enough light to see well. Had to figure out which end to unscrew as the machining was in good tolerances. That was fun. Glad there were two. For the price, can't beat it."

852,"Fantastic Little Flashlight, Except...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 30, 2017","Really love these little flashlights, they're the best I've found on market. Small, VERY powerful for their size, focusable and only require one AA battery.Why not 5 stars? Because of the three modes that you must cycle through every time. I have a couple of flashlights that stay in the same mode unless you repeatedly press the button, and then stay in that mode until changed again. That's the way all of these should work. It's a real pain to have to click so many times, just to get back to the only setting I'll use: high. Make that change and I'll buy a dozen for everyone in the family."

857,Bright little lights. Good buy.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 27, 2017","Great little lights. The only two downsides are that the clip is tempered and will break if you try to bend it a little more so it's easier to clip on your pocket. The other is that when you turn it off, and then back on it goes to the next mode. So if you turn it off on the bright setting and turn it turn it back on, it'll be on the low setting. The modes are bright, low, & strobe. So I just switch it to strobe before I turn it off, that way it comes on bright. Not a deal breaker for me. But for some it might be."

Well, maybe a bigger flashlight. These things are tiny but crank an amazing amount of light given their size. Good for car, purse or pocket. Or to clip on your belt. The ability to focus the beam from narrow to wide is a plus. Be sure to wait for the sales. Prices are all over the map on these things, from as little as $8 (for 2) to almost $30. A good deal at the lower price point."

One of the push button toggle switches works only when it feels like it - and it's not often it feels like it.  The other 3 flashlights work okay, but I wonder how long before their push button toggle switch craps out.This is the first time in 14 years of shopping with Amazon that a product we purchased doesn't work.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.It's not worth the hassle to send a $4 flashlight back. It should be thrown away, but then I'm throwing away $4 of my money.  It's not the money, it's the principle.  Come on Amazon, just suck it up and mail me a working replacement."

884,Great quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on April 19, 2017","With a house full of boys my flash light are always turning up missing. So I find myself looking for smaller but strong and bright flashlights. These led flashlights from rockbirds are the perfect choice for my family. They are small and very sturdy. Strong and very bright. There are what I would call 3 different modes of light. The first is a regular flashlight beam. This light is very bright and shows a long distance from the user. Next is a more.focused beam just pull on the flashlight and you get a smaller more focused beam of light in a square. Next is a flashing mode. I like this one best because I will take the dogs for a walk in the morning before it is light out and I can use this in flashing mode attach it to my jacket so that drivers can see me.Overall I have been very impressed with the quality of this flashlight. It is small and light weight. Perfect to keep in your purse, car glove box or anywhere else you might need to."

They're great to keep in your toolbox, glovebox or purse. Also great to keep in a kitchen drawer for power outages, just in case.At just over 3.5"" long they emit a super strong beam of LED light. They are really solid and have a nice weight to them. Two AA batteries (not included) is all it takes to operate them both. I'm going to keep one in the car and use one for camping.Since they're water-resistant I can bring it out on the kayak for those evening paddles and I won't have to worry about the flashlight getting splashed."

They are small enough that I kept one in my glove box in my car and one in the bathroom vanity in our upstairs bathroom.  When the electricity goes out it always seems like I can never find the flashlights now I have them on every level of my home. With one simple Double A battery they are ready to go.  They really give off a lot of light for a small flashlight.  I also like the fact that they have a setting that is like a strobe light.  That is why I decided to keep one in the car if we ever get stuck in the dark it can be used to flag someone down. I will be purchasing more of these!

These are perfect for that purpose- they're lightweight enough yet comfortable to hold. I like that it comes in a pack of two, so I have a backup. The clip allows me to attach it to the pocket in my handbag for easy retrieval. And for a small flashlight, the LED light is strong, so I can see myself holding this for a long time in case of a power outage, unlike other powerful flashlights that are large, bulky and heavy."

Each flashlight has side clips that make it easy to attach to a pocket so they can be carried and not lost. The push button design is comfortable and works well. Each flashlight requires 1 AA battery to operate, which is quite impressive based on the actual light output from such a compact design. There are three different light settings and an easy to grip housing design. I've found these to be great little lights for around the house and in the vehicle."

921,Amazing Light Output!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 31, 2017","These are a new fad right now and it seems that the single battery LED Flashlight are working tons better than the multi-battery ones.  Seems like that shouldn't be the case but it is my experience with these so far!  I bought this particular one because of the saving I got from it being a 2 pack.  I used the extra to give to my parents.  Make a great gift, especially when you can show how great and bright the light is for such a small unit."
922,Great small flashlight,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 30, 2017","My husband works in the oilfield so I grabbed this two pack for him and his friend to use while at work. They are simple, only take 1 battery, and they really liked the brightness of the light and the fact that it has a tight clip on it so it stays in their pocket well."

The flashlight is bright, has a belt clip, fits perfectly in your hand and compact.  It has a caution mode, where the light blinks to let others know something is wrong. HOpefully no one will ever have to use that setting.  This flashlight being so compact is great for you need to look under cabinets and small spaces.  My husband used it for the lower compartment on his boat."
925,"Awesome flashlights, small and portable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 26, 2017","Really cool little flashlights. These are fairly small and light but they are also very sturdy. They do not feel cheap or weak in any way. Really nice quality, well made. I like that they are small, makes them super portable. I also like the adjustable focus feature, could come in handy. I definitely like these and can surely recommend this product."

They are the perfect size for your purse, pocket, fanny pack or to store in the door of your car.  They are easy to use and very bright. They come in a pack of two. I put one in my Jeep and the other in my husbands truck.  I have used mine every time I have come home at night and needed to light my way to the door.  I highly recommend these flashlights."
932,Great little flashlights that put out Great light,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 17, 2017","Great little flashlights that put out Great light. I recently started with a volunteer Fire Department and was looking for tools to fill my pockets with. Flashlights are one of those key tools. This little flashlight is simple to use and even with it being so small and with wearing gloves, it is easy to turn on and off. Definitely worth the buy."
933,small but powerful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 16, 2017","These are small enough to carry in a purse or backpack. I personally carry one in my purse for those times when I am going to my car late in the evening and need a light to see.  I take evening classes and sometimes going to my car is a little scary, so I really like having the flashlight readily available. It eases my stress and fears waking to my car being able to actually see.  We recently lost power and I used my rockbird flashlight most of the evening. I was amazed at how long and well it worked. I am very happy with these flashlights and look forward to using them for camping and hiking over the summer. I am impressed for as small as they are, they emit quite a bit of light."

936,very bright led flashlights,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 14, 2017",Very bright flashlight. I like the LED glow vs the regular lens. Item come packed well in a box. Very good quality. Metal casing that can stand up to wear and tear. I plan on using these lights for emergency and also when we go camping. It is nice that there is a place to put a clip or lanyard.
937,so they don't get held to super high standards,3.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 13, 2017","They cheap, so they don't get held to super high standards. The slide to amplify light is only useful when at max power. The light gets focused into some logo I can't make out. Not good or bad, just an observation."
938,Super bright little lights that work well.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 11, 2017","Super bright little flashlights. The focus on them is fun, but usually not very necessary. They seem like they can handle a pretty good beating. I carry one on my belt at work as it is compact, lightweight, and it comes in really handy. The only complaint I have is I wish the belt clip was heavier; I snagged it on my bench the other day while I was working and bent it all up. I took off the clip (held on by two small allen screws) and applied some love with a pair of pliers and it works great again. I don't know if anyone else would have this problem and it's easy to fix, so it's not worth taking off a star. I may make a heavier clip for it myself though.Overall, they do what I expect them to do."
939,Great little flashlights,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 10, 2017",This set of two flashlights are a great deal in my opinion.  I gave my husband one to use in his tow truck and one stays in the house for me. These flashlights are very bright and you can adjust the scope of the light from a large area to a precise close area. I use my flashlight in the house to check on eggs in an incubator so I pull the top of the flashlight out to narrow the scope. It is plenty bright for me to see the babies in the eggs. My husband has used his for lots of things in the tow truck. It is great for lots of jobs since it has adjustable lighting. It's also easy for him to keep on himself with the metal clip and non-slip grip.  I like that they are made with aluminium so they are lightweight and durable. So far they show no wear and tear even though we are constantly using them.
940,"great, small and so bright",5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 9, 2017","Tell you the truth... i bought them for my mother in law who was always complaining about not having flashlight when ahe loses power in the house and ahe bothered me to borrow mine. Now since I got her these flashlights she doesnt even use them and keep bugging me for flashlights... guess what i took flashlights back for myself and borrow her the ones i bought her... great , small and so bright... ask my mother in law!!"

These have been in daily carry/use for three months with no complaints.  Very bright, work great, good battery life and a variable beam at a great price....what is not to like?Remember...it is not a Streamlight, SureFire, Fenix, etc....but it works, and it's 5$.  Worth every penny!"

946,Good deal!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 7, 2017",The flashlights are light weight and very bright. Once you put the battery on it's a bit difficult to put the bottom back on. But it's a clear white light and not that yellow hue. So it's a great find especially since you get two! I use them when I'm walking around at night and it doesn't take up space at all.
947,Heavy Duty and Bright,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 7, 2017",These are good quality tactical flashlights. They have three modes and in the video I am posting along with this review you can see the difference in the 3 modes which are changeable with a click of the button at the end of the flashlight. There is a sturdy pocket clip mounted to the side of the flashlights with two small screws. So far I haven't had any problems with the flashlights which seem to be pretty durable and are just what I expected.
948,Awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 6, 2017","No problems at all ,strong lil lights"
949,Great flashlight.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 5, 2017","I use this flashlight for work. It has awesome brightness and uses one AA battery as opposed to the expensive special batteries the tactical flashlights usually take. Works great for up close or zoom it in for distance. Definitely a good buy, especially for the price."
950,A nice LED (small) flashlight!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 5, 2017","I purchased the LED Flashlight by Rockbirds because I wanted a flashlight I could easily put into the center console of my Jeep. This flashlight is perfect because it is small enough to fit just about anywhere that you want to put a flashlight. You could carry this in your purse, your vehicle, it even has a clip for a belt. Just remember, batteries are not included. So you will need two AA batteries. I am pleased with this purchase. :-)"
951,... bought a pair similar to these previously and really like the design,2.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 5, 2017",I had bought a pair similar to these previously and really like the design. This brand however was cheapened considerably. I was not impressed with the switch most of all. Being not as crisp as the other brand.
952,Very fast shipping!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 4, 2017",This is probably the best and most compact set of flashlights I've ever owned! I don't like candles so they are perfect for power outages and I'm always losing things so the ultra brightness is very effective for that too!
953,Quality made and a fantastic deal!  Let me show you how they work.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on March 4, 2017",These Rockbirds LED Flashlights I bought came it a pack of 2 for only $9.99 which is a crazy good deal.  I collect LED flashlights and have about 30 right now but I really like these smaller ones because I can just keep them in my pocket.These are heavy duty and made with aluminum.  The battery compartment has an O ring to keep moisture out.  They are waterproof but not to be submerged in water but they will withstand rain.The beam is adjustable and you can see that in the video I provided to go with this review and I also show all 3 modes of lighting.  All you need to do is slightly tap the on and off switch and it will change modes.Please watch the video to get a better idea of what I am talking about.  Overall it is excellent for the price and you get 2!  I give this 5 stars easily.  I hoped this helped in some way.

977,and the illumination is great for the size,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on January 6, 2017","These are very small flashlights. They feel very solid though, and the illumination is great for the size. They easily clip inside the pocket of a pair of jeans and feel very similar to a clipped folding knife in my pocket. The housing at the end of the light slides in and out to adjust the beam, and there is a strobe setting on the light when you press the power button off and on again. Two lights come in the package. At first it seemed a little spendy for them when looking at their size, but as I have used it, and had it in my pocket, these are 20 times the light you get at a dollar store, or by spending less somewhere else. I bought 3 packs of 2. They have held up under the abuse my son's and friends dish out so far. And, they are very compact."
978,Excellent Flashlights,5.0 out of 5 stars,"on January 5, 2017","These flashlights are awesome. They are very small but provide a super-bright light.

Bought some from another company in colors, and a few had problems, so they are not prefect, but for the price, amazing even if one out of 10 does not work.Seem to use up batteries a bit faster, but with only one battery at a time, seems to be OK or on par with other flashlights on battery use.Have 10 now, all over house, use them all the time, fantastic."

They're definitely not streamlight flashlights, but I mean, for the kids to have in their pocket while we're camping, who cares. They put off a square light. They squareness dissipates some as you zoom it. If you want a cheap couple lights for the kids, grab these. But for your car or backpack, I'd spend a bit more."
